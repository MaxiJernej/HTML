                    <p>This documentation describes our project we did in the first two weeks of our internship:
                    <p>The task was to make a video of ourself and let our partner take a picture of himself. With those two </p>
                    <p>inputs and a small amount of code, we then should be able to swap the face in the video with the </p> 
                    <p>face on the photo. That’s it...</p>

                                A video consists of many frames. Those frames are just the number of times images are flashed 
                                on a screen during a given second to give the illusion of movement. To be able to work with the 
                                video, we now had to split it into many frames and work on those pictures one after another.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To have a consistency in every picture it was necessary to have the face always in the same 
                                position in the image. To accomplish this we zoomed into the picture so that only the face and 
                                nothing more is fitting into it. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If that was done on every frames separately we are know able to put the frames back together. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After that milestone we know take our picture and also zoom into it, know the picture should  
                                contain only the face and no other surroundings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                At the end our algorithm takes those two documents and exchanges the faces.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
